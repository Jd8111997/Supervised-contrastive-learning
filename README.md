# Supervised-Contrastive-Learning
Implementation of Supervised Contrastive Learning for pretrained language models[https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.01403].

In this project, we tried to reproduce the paper results on SST2 and CoLA datasets.     
Although, we couldn't reproduce the results for few shot learning tasks(20 and 50 training samples), but when training on whole dataset, we got 1.5% gain on test accuracy, which is sampled from original dev set and it contains 500 samples with equal distribution of labels.
